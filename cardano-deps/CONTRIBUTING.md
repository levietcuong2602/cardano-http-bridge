# How Can I Contribute?

## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for rust cardano and
related projects.  Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the
community understand your report, reproduce the behavior and find related
reports.

## Before Submitting A Bug Report

* Determine which repository the problem should be reported in.
* Perform a cursory search to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bug are tracked as github issues, do not email the developpers directly:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps

## Pull Requests

To contribute changes to the code, we use github pull requests:

* Simple to accept changes.
* Allow developpers community to review contributions
* Easy to track what's being work on / in progress.

## Style

### Rust style

* We don't enforce a *specific* style.
* We mostly follow a style similar to rustfmt.
* Follow the style of the code you're contributing to.
* Do not submit auto-reformating, and/or code style change as part of another work.
* Use markdown for documentation

### Commits

* We value small descriptive commit that do one thing at a time, as much as possible.
* Keep history clean : don't hesitate to reorder and squash commits if necessary.
* Do not merge the master branch in your topic branch
