# Rust implementation of Cardano primitives, helpers, and related applications

Cardano Rust is a modular toolbox of Cardanoâ€™s cryptographic primitives, a
library of wallet functions and a future alternative Cardano node
implementation written in Rust. It can be used by any third-party to build
wallet applications and interact with the Cardano blockchain.

## Installation

If this is a new installation:
[install rust's toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html).

We support the following states; `stable`, `unstable` and `nightly`.

We also support the `wasm32` target.

## Building the Library

To build the library, use:

```
cargo build
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests, use:

```
cargo test
```

## How to integrate the Rust library in your project

Information will be available soon on crates.io

In the mean time, it is possible to add the project using git submodules:

```git submodule add https://github.com/input-output-hk/rust-cardano cardano-deps```

And then by adding the following to your Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
cardano = { path = "cardano-deps/cardano" }
```
